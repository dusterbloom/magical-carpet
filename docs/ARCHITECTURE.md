# Game Architecture Overview

## Core Systems

### Engine
The main game engine handles:
- Rendering setup and management
- System coordination
- Game loop
- Resource management
- Event handling

### Input System
Supports:
- Keyboard/Mouse controls
- Touch controls with virtual joystick
- Event-based input handling

### Physics System
Features:
- Velocity-based movement
- Terrain collision
- Gravity simulation
- Drag and acceleration
- Speed limiting

### World System
Implements:
- Procedural terrain generation
- Height-based collision
- World boundaries
- Environment rendering

### Player System
Manages:
- Player movement and rotation
- Health and mana systems
- Position synchronization
- Collision detection
- Camera controls

### Network System
Handles:
- Player state synchronization
- Basic AI player simulation
- Network event management
- Player updates broadcasting

## Performance Considerations
- Uses device pixel ratio limiting
- Implements proper delta time handling
- Includes development performance monitoring
- Optimized renderer settings
