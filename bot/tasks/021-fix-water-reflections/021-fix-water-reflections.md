# Task: Fix Water Reflections Issues

## 1. Task & Context

**Files**: 
- `src/game/systems/WaterSystem.js`

**Issue**:
Based on the screenshots, when flying over or close to the water, there appear to be visual glitches with the water reflections. The screenshots show turquoise and red colored planes of water with some visual artifacts. The sky and cloud reflections may be contributing to rendering issues.

## 2. Quick Plan

**How**:
1. Analyze the current water implementation
2. Adjust reflection properties in the Water object
3. Improve clipBias and distortion settings
4. Ensure proper reflection texture processing
5. Add optional fog to match scene atmospheric conditions

**Complexity**: 2/3  
**Uncertainty**: 2/3

## 3. Implementation

The current implementation uses Three.js Water object which handles reflections, but appears to have issues with artifacts and possibly z-fighting. The key problems are:

1. The clipBias value is too low (0.00001) which can cause reflection precision issues
2. The distortionScale is high (1.5) which might cause excessive warping
3. The water doesn't properly sync with the sun direction from the atmosphere system
4. The water currently lacks texture repetition settings

Let's modify the WaterSystem.js to address these issues:

```js
createWater() {
  const waterGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(10000, 10000);

  const water = new Water(waterGeometry, {
    textureWidth: 2048,
    textureHeight: 2048,
    waterNormals: new TextureLoader().load('textures/2waternormals.jpg', function (texture) {
      texture.wrapS = texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
      texture.repeat.set(2, 2); // Gentle repeat to reduce stretching
    }),
    sunDirection: new THREE.Vector3(0, 1, 0), // Will be updated in update method
    sunColor: 0xffffff,
    waterColor: 0x001e0f,
    distortionScale: 1.0, // Slightly reduced from 1.5
    clipBias: 0.0008, // Moderately increased to reduce z-fighting
    fog: this.scene.fog !== undefined,
    alpha: 0.9 // Slight transparency
  });

  water.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 2;
  water.position.y = this.waterLevel;
  
  // Add custom material properties to reduce artifacts
  water.material.transparent = true;
  water.material.side = THREE.FrontSide;

  this.water = water;
  this.scene.add(water);
}

update(deltaTime) {
  if (this.water) {
    // Update time at a reduced rate to slow down wave animation
    this.water.material.uniforms['time'].value += deltaTime * 0.8;
    
    // Sync with atmosphere system sun direction if available
    if (this.engine.systems.atmosphere && this.engine.systems.atmosphere.sunLight) {
      const sunDirection = this.engine.systems.atmosphere.sunLight.position.clone().normalize();
      this.water.material.uniforms['sunDirection'].value.copy(sunDirection);
    }
  }

  if (this.engine.camera) {
    // Follow camera but round to integer to avoid sub-pixel rendering issues
    this.water.position.x = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.x);
    this.water.position.z = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.z);
    
    // Adjust water transparency based on camera position
    // More transparent when underwater, more opaque when above
    if (this.isUnderwater(this.engine.camera.position)) {
      this.water.material.uniforms['alpha'].value = 0.7;
    } else {
      this.water.material.uniforms['alpha'].value = 0.9;
    }
  }
}
```

## 4. Check & Commit

Changes made:
- Added texture repeat (2x2) for more natural wave patterns
- Moderately reduced distortionScale from 1.5 to 1.0
- Increased clipBias from 0.00001 to 0.0008 to reduce z-fighting
- Added subtle transparency settings (0.9 above water, 0.7 underwater)
- Slowed wave animation speed (0.8Ã— original)
- Synchronized water with sun direction from atmosphere system
- Rounded water position to integer values to reduce sub-pixel artifacts

These changes should improve the water's visual quality when flying over or near the water surface, reduce the visual glitches, and better integrate the sky and cloud reflections in the water.
