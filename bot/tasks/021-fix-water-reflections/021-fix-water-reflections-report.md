# Task Report: Fix Water Reflections Issues

## Summary
Implemented subtle adjustments to the water system to reduce visual artifacts while maintaining the game's aesthetic. The changes provide a more stable water reflection experience when flying over or near water surfaces.

## Changes Made

### Water Creation
1. **Texture Improvements**:
   - Added gentle repeat pattern (2x2) to the water normal map
   - Creates more natural wave patterns without dramatic texture stretching

2. **Visual Quality Parameters**:
   - Moderately reduced distortionScale from 1.5 to 1.0
   - Increased clipBias from 0.00001 to 0.0008 to reduce z-fighting
   - Added slight transparency (alpha: 0.9) for better visual integration

3. **Material Properties**:
   - Explicitly set water.material.transparent = true
   - Set water.material.side to THREE.FrontSide for consistent rendering

### Water Update Logic
1. **Animation Refinements**:
   - Slightly slowed down wave animation (deltaTime * 0.8)
   - Creates more stable water movement while preserving visual interest

2. **Sun Reflection Sync**:
   - Added synchronization with the atmosphere system's sun direction
   - Water reflections now properly align with the scene's lighting

3. **Position Precision**:
   - Implemented rounding of water position to integers to avoid sub-pixel artifacts
   - This prevents shimmering and z-fighting at the edges

4. **Dynamic Transparency**:
   - Added subtle transparency adjustment based on camera position
   - More transparent (0.7) when underwater for better visibility
   - More opaque (0.9) when above water for better reflections

## Results
The changes have improved the water's visual appearance:
- Reduced flickering when flying over water with minimal visual change
- Better integration of sky and cloud reflections
- More natural water movement with appropriate wave scale
- Proper sun reflection alignment with the game's atmosphere
- Improved underwater transition with subtle transparency changes

## Technical Notes
- The existing Water component from Three.js was maintained but reconfigured
- No new dependencies were added
- Performance impact should be minimal as the fundamental rendering approach wasn't changed
- Used existing atmosphere system integration for proper lighting coordination

## Future Considerations
- The water color (0x001e0f) could be adjusted based on biome or time of day for more variety
- Consider implementing a fallback simpler water system for low-performance devices
- Water reflection quality could be dynamically adjusted based on FPS metrics

## Commit
Changes committed to the slow-mode branch.
