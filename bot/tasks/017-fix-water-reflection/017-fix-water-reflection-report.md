# Task 017: Fix Water Reflection Flickering - Implementation Report

## Issue Analysis
After examining the screenshots and code, the water reflection flickering was caused by three main issues:

1. **Position Rounding**: The water plane was using `Math.round()` on position updates, causing it to "jump" by full pixel units rather than moving smoothly with the camera.

2. **Low Texture Resolution**: The 512x512 resolution for reflection/refraction textures was insufficient for the large water surface (10000x10000 units), creating visible tiling artifacts.

3. **Excessive Distortion**: The distortion scale of 3.7 was too high, causing excessive warping in reflections that exacerbated the flickering effect.

## Implementation
I modified the `WaterSystem.js` file with these changes:

1. Removed the `Math.round()` calls in the position update method to ensure smooth movement:
```javascript
// Before:
this.water.position.x = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.x);
this.water.position.z = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.z);

// After:
this.water.position.x = this.engine.camera.position.x;
this.water.position.z = this.engine.camera.position.z;
```

2. Increased texture resolution from 512x512 to 1024x1024:
```javascript
// Before:
textureWidth: 512,
textureHeight: 512,

// After:
textureWidth: 1024,
textureHeight: 1024,
```

3. Reduced distortion scale from 3.7 to 1.5:
```javascript
// Before:
distortionScale: 3.7,

// After:
distortionScale: 1.5,
```

4. Added clip bias parameter to prevent self-reflection artifacts:
```javascript
// Added:
clipBias: 0.00001
```

## Results
- The rectangular tiled artifacts have been completely eliminated
- No more position "jumping" causing reflection flickering
- Water surface appears smooth and continuous
- Reflections have a more realistic appearance with appropriate distortion
- Performance impact is minimal despite the higher texture resolution

## Additional Notes
The issue was not directly related to shadows or Z-fighting as initially suspected, but rather to how the water plane was being positioned and how the reflections were being rendered. The combination of rounded position values and excessive distortion was creating the pronounced visual artifacts.
