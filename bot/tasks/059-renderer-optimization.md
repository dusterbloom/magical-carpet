# Task059: Optimize Rendering Pipeline

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Improve renderer configuration and implement platform-specific rendering optimizations
**Scope:** `src/game/core/Engine.js` - specifically the renderer configuration and rendering loop, and `src/game/core/WorldSystem.js` for frustum culling
**Branch:** `renderer-optimization`

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** 
- Implement conditional renderer configuration based on device capabilities
- Add adaptive draw call batching 
- Optimize render loop to reduce CPU/GPU overhead
- Implement frustum culling in WorldSystem to skip rendering off-screen geometry

**Complexity:** 3-Complex
**Uncertainty:** 2-Medium
**Unknowns:** 
- Performance impact of shader complexity reduction on visual quality
- Exact impact of various WebGL parameters across different GPUs

**Human Input Needed:** No - changes maintain visual quality while improving performance

## 3. Implementation

The implementation focused on two critical aspects:

1. Optimizing the rendering pipeline in Engine.js:
   - Device capability detection for platform-specific optimizations
   - Adaptive renderer configuration based on detected capabilities
   - Frame skipping logic for low-end devices
   - Efficient shadow map updates with tiered update frequency
   - Pre/post render optimization hooks

2. Implementing frustum culling in WorldSystem.js:
   - Created the necessary frustum culling implementation in WorldSystem.js
   - Added logic to dynamically create bounding boxes for terrain chunks
   - Implemented visibility toggling based on camera frustum intersection
   - Added support for culling landmark objects
   - Optimized to avoid unnecessary visibility changes

The frustum culling implementation in `updateVisibility()` achieves several key optimizations:
- Avoids rendering geometry that isn't visible to the camera
- Dynamically creates bounding boxes for chunks if they don't exist
- Only changes visibility when needed to avoid unnecessary state changes
- Handles both terrain chunks and landmark objects
- Properly updates when camera parameters change
