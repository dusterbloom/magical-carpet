# Updated Mobile Controls Implementation

## Final Controls Configuration

1. **Simplified UI**
   - Single joystick on the right side of the screen
   - Space button (up arrow) on the left side
   - Debug toggle button in top-right corner

2. **Control Functionality**
   - Joystick handles:
     - Left/right movement (X-axis): Steering
     - Up/down movement (Y-axis): Precise altitude adjustment
   - Space button: Acts exactly like spacebar (altitude up)
   - Auto-forward always active at 50% speed

3. **Visual Design**
   - Space button uses blue color with up arrow symbol
   - Joystick has improved visibility and touch response
   - First-person camera view optimized for mobile play

## Testing Instructions
- Test joystick for turning and altitude control
- Verify that the space button functions exactly like the spacebar on desktop
- Confirm that auto-forward works consistently
- Test that debug overlay (D button) shows correct input values

## Implementation Notes
- Space button mimics spacebar functionality for consistency with desktop
- Auto-forward keeps the carpet moving without needing a dedicated control
- Joystick tracking improved to properly match touch ID
