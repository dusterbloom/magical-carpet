# Mobile Controls Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Touch controls were not being initialized on mobile devices
2. Joystick control was not handling touch events correctly
3. Device orientation controls were not properly activated
4. Debug information was missing to diagnose mobile issues

## Changes Made

### InputManager.js
1. Added better logging throughout touch event handling
2. Added a touchcancel event handler to prevent "stuck" touches
3. Improved device orientation handling to work better on iOS and Android
4. Added automatic device motion detection and initialization
5. Enhanced error handling for DeviceOrientationEvent permission requests

### PlayerInput.js
1. Improved joystick event handling with touch ID tracking
2. Enhanced touch control styling for better visibility
3. Added a debug overlay to show the status of mobile controls
4. Fixed the touch control buttons to use fixed positioning
5. Added code to make joystick more responsive
6. Added a toggle switch to hide/show debug information

### PlayerSystem.js
1. Added code to initialize touch controls when on a mobile device

## Testing Notes
- The debug overlay shows vital information about device orientation, joystick position, and player movement
- Mobile controls now include:
  - Virtual joystick (left side): Forward/Backward and Left/Right turning
  - Altitude buttons (right side): Up and Down movement
  - Fire button (right side): Cast spells
  - Optional motion controls: Tilt device for movement

## Verification Steps
1. Open game on a mobile device
2. Confirm touch controls appear and respond to input
3. Check debug overlay to verify input values
4. Test both joystick and motion controls for movement
5. Verify that altitude buttons work correctly

## Debugging
- The debug overlay can be toggled on/off by tapping the 'D' button in the top-right corner
- Watch the debug overlay to see live updates of device orientation and joystick position
- Console logs have been added to help identify when touch events occur
