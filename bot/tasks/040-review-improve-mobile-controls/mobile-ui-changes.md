# Mobile UI Controls Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Simplified UI for Mobile
- Removed FIRE button and altitude controls (UP/DOWN) to reduce UI clutter
- Added a single TURBO button on the left side for speed boost
- Moved the joystick to the right side for easier thumb control

### 2. Enhanced Joystick Controls
- Single joystick now handles both:
  - Left/Right movement (X-axis): Steering the carpet
  - Up/Down movement (Y-axis): Controlling altitude
- Increased joystick size and visibility for better control

### 3. Auto-Forward Movement
- Enabled automatic forward movement at 50% speed for mobile devices
- TURBO button temporarily increases speed to 100% when pressed
- This makes the game more playable with a single joystick

### 4. Improved Camera View
- Adjusted camera position to be more appropriate for mobile play

### Testing Notes
- The joystick should now handle all movement needs:
  - Drag left/right to turn
  - Drag up to descend
  - Drag down to ascend
- TURBO button provides speed boost when needed
- Default forward movement ensures continuous gameplay

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding a simple fire mechanism (double-tap joystick?)
- Evaluate whether a mini-map toggle might be useful
- Collect user feedback on single-joystick control scheme
