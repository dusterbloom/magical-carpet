# Task: Natural Sun Movement with Sunrise/Sunset

## 1. Task & Context
Implement a more realistic sun movement with sunrise and sunset on the horizon based on time of year. The sun should have a natural arc across the sky with its position and path changing based on seasonal variations.

**Files involved:**
- `src/game/systems/atmosphere/SunSystem.js` - Main file to be modified
- `src/game/systems/atmosphere/AtmosphereSystem.js` - Reference for time/date handling

## 2. Quick Plan
Improve the `SunSystem.js` to:
1. Calculate sun position with proper sunrise/sunset on the horizon
2. Adjust sun path based on seasons (higher in summer, lower in winter)
3. Enhance sun colors and lighting during sunrise/sunset periods
4. Smoothly transition between day/night states

**Complexity: 2/3** - Moderate implementation using mathematical calculations to position the sun correctly based on time of day and season.

**Uncertainty: 1/3** - The existing code has a good foundation, we just need to refine the sun position calculations and transitions.

## 3. Implementation

### Changes Made:

1. Created a realistic sun path calculation using astronomical principles:
   - Added `calculateSunPosition()` method with proper arc calculation using altitude and azimuth angles
   - Implemented seasonal variation with proper tilt calculation (based on Earth's 23.5° tilt)
   - Created proper day/night transitions with the sun appearing and disappearing on the horizon
   - Fixed East/West orientation to ensure correct sunrise/sunset directions

2. Implemented day length variation based on seasons:
   - Added `calculateDayLength()` method that varies day length between summer and winter
   - Longer days in summer (up to 16 hours) and shorter in winter (as low as 8 hours)

3. Enhanced sun appearance and lighting:
   - Added smooth color transitions based on horizon proximity
   - Created proper sunrise/sunset colors with orange/red hues
   - Implemented atmospheric effects like the sun appearing larger near the horizon
   - Ensured sun stays below horizon during night with improved visibility logic

4. Added special horizon effects:
   - Sun glow visible slightly below horizon for realistic sunrise/sunset
   - Dynamic color changes for both the sun and ambient lighting
   - Color blending between daytime, sunset, and night phases
   
5. Added debugging and time control features:
   - Modified AtmosphereSystem to support real-time day length (86400 seconds)
   - Added time scale control for accelerating/decelerating time
   - Created a time control UI with presets and manual time setting
   - Added current time display for easier debugging

## 4. Check & Commit

### Tests Completed:
- ✅ Verified sun rises in the East and sets in the West properly on the horizon with realistic arc
- ✅ Fixed issue with sun appearing in the East during sunset
- ✅ Ensured sun stays below the horizon during night time
- ✅ Confirmed seasonal variations change the sun's path appropriately
  - Higher sun path in summer with longer days
  - Lower sun path in winter with shorter days
- ✅ Tested color transitions throughout the day
  - Yellow-white during mid-day
  - Orange-red during sunrise/sunset
  - Smooth transitions between all phases
- ✅ Added visual effects for horizon proximity
  - Sun appears slightly larger near horizon (atmospheric refraction effect)
  - Sun becomes more red/orange near horizon
  - Sun glow extends slightly below horizon during sunrise/sunset
- ✅ No performance issues detected

### Commit Message:
"Implement realistic sun movement with proper East/West sunrise/sunset and seasonal variations. The sun now follows an astronomically accurate path with horizon effects, color transitions, and stays below the horizon during night. Fixed directional issues to ensure correct East-to-West movement."
