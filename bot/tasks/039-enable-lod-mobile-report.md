# Enable LOD for Mobile Devices - Completion Report

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Enable Level of Detail (LOD) for mobile devices to improve performance 
**Scope:** Fix THREE reference error in MobileLODManager.js preventing mobile LOD implementation from working
**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** Add missing THREE import to MobileLODManager.js
**Complexity:** 2-Medium
**Uncertainty:** 2-Medium (needed to check implementation details)

## 3. Implementation
The issue was that the MobileLODManager.js file was using the THREE object (specifically at line 149 in the applyInitialOptimizations method) without importing it. The fix was straightforward:

1. Added the import statement at the top of MobileLODManager.js:
```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";
```

This resolves the error that was preventing the mobile LOD system from initializing:
```
main.js?t=1743441985520:17 Error initializing game: ReferenceError: THREE is not defined
    at MobileLODManager.applyInitialOptimizations (MobileLODManager.js:149:47)
```

The MobileLODManager can now properly initialize and apply optimizations for mobile devices, including:
- Reduced shadow map quality
- Dynamic terrain LOD based on distance
- Reduced vegetation density
- Dynamic pixel ratio adjustment
- Selective water reflections

## 4. Check & Commit
**Status:** Complete
**Testing:** Verified the error is resolved and mobile optimization is now functioning

**Commit Message:** "Fix THREE reference error in MobileLODManager.js for mobile LOD"
