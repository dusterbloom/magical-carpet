# Task 053: Code Quality and Cleanup

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Perform a codebase cleanup pass to improve quality, consistency, and remove minor issues identified in the review.
**Scope:** src/, index.html
**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** 
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Make global variables conditional on development environment
- Remove temporary files
- Add error handling around critical operations
- Check for safe usage of potentially undefined objects

**Complexity:** 1/3
**Uncertainty:** 1/3
**Unknowns:** Impact of changes on performance profile
**Human Input Needed:** No

## 3. Implementation
1. In src/main.js:
   - Wrapped window.gameEngine global in import.meta.env.DEV conditional to only expose in development

2. In index.html:
   - Updated getPerformanceReport to handle production mode where gameEngine isn't globally available

3. In WaterSystem.js:
   - Added comprehensive WATER_CONSTANTS object with all magic numbers
   - Updated all hardcoded values to use constants
   - Added proper error handling in initialize() and createWater() methods
   - Added null checks for engine systems
   
4. Removed tmp.txt file from src/game/systems

5. Added descriptive comments for better code clarity

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made:**
- Restricted window.gameEngine global to development builds
- Replaced magic numbers with named constants in water system
- Removed temporary/test files
- Added error handling for critical system initializations 
- Added null checks for potentially undefined references

**Commit Message:** chore: Code quality improvements and cleanup

**Status:** Complete
