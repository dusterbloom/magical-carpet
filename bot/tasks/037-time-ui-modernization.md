# Task 037: Modernize Time Setting UI

## Task & Context
- Move time settings UI to avoid overlapping with mana display
- Make time UI collapsible with a toggle button
- Replace text buttons with icons for presets (Midnight, Sunrise, Noon, Sunset)
- Update time scale options (replacing 720x with 120x)
- Implement modern UI matching mockup with rounded corners and grid layout
- Add slider for custom time control

## Quick Plan
- Modify UISystem.js to update the createTimeControls method (complexity: 2, uncertainty: 1)
- Add collapsible functionality with toggle button (complexity: 1, uncertainty: 1)
- Use emoji icons for time presets instead of traditional buttons (complexity: 1, uncertainty: 1)
- Add setTime method to AtmosphereSystem if not already present (complexity: 1, uncertainty: 1)
- Position UI to avoid overlapping with mana display (complexity: 1, uncertainty: 1)
- Implement slider for custom time setting (complexity: 2, uncertainty: 1)

## Implementation
1. Updated the `createTimeControls` method in UISystem.js to:
- Add a toggle button (‚è±Ô∏è) in the upper right corner
- Make the time UI collapsible (initially hidden, toggled by the button)
- Position the UI panel below the mana display to avoid overlap
- Use a more modern, visually appealing design with darker colors and rounded corners
   - Replace text buttons with emoji icons for time presets (üåô, üåÖ, ‚òÄÔ∏è, üåá)
   - Update time scale options to Real, 2x, 60x, 120x (replacing 720x with 120x)
- Implement a slider for custom time control instead of number inputs
- Add hover effects and visual feedback for better UX
- Add a close button in the top-right corner of the panel

2. Added the `setTime` method to AtmosphereSystem.js to allow direct time setting:
```javascript
   setTime(hour, minute) {
     this.timeOfDay = (hour + minute / 60) / 24;
     console.log(`Time set to ${hour}:${minute} (${this.timeOfDay.toFixed(4)})`); 
   }
   ```

## Check & Commit
- Verified that the toggle button appears in the upper right corner without overlapping mana display
- Confirmed that clicking the toggle button shows/hides the time UI panel
- Tested that the close button properly hides the panel
- Confirmed that all time preset icons (Midnight, Sunrise, Noon, Sunset) work correctly
- Tested time scale buttons to ensure they properly affect simulation speed
- Verified that the custom time slider properly adjusts the time
- Visual appearance matches the mockup with modern styling
