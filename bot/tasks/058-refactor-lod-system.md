# Task: Redesign LOD Management System

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Refactor Level of Detail (LOD) system to eliminate expensive asset recreation and implement property-based LOD transitions
**Scope:** `src/game/core/MobileLODManager.js` and `src/game/systems/WaterSystem.js`
**Branch:** `slow-mode`

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** Replace asset recreation with property manipulation for LOD transitions, implement a more efficient LOD distance calculation system, and add explicit method for toggling reflection without water recreation.
**Complexity:** 3-Complex
**Uncertainty:** 2-Medium
**Unknowns:** 
- Internal architecture of the water system
- Potential side effects in visual quality when modifying existing materials

**Human Input Needed:** No - Understood the water system architecture by examining the existing code

## 3. Implementation
1. Added `setReflectionEnabled()` method to WaterSystem for non-destructive reflection toggling
2. Implemented reflection render target optimization (2x2 minimal texture when disabled)
3. Removed expensive water recreation from LOD management system
4. Added `cleanupReflectionResources()` method for proper resource management
5. Implemented `getTerrainResolutionMultiplier()` for more granular control
6. Enhanced LOD adjustment logic with more stable transitions
7. Updated quality level management to use non-destructive property updates

Key changes:
- WaterSystem now toggles reflections by modifying properties of existing materials
- Reduced texture sizes for disabled reflections to improve performance
- LOD transitions now happen without recreating assets
- Better hysteresis in quality level changes to prevent oscillation

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made:**
- Modified `WaterSystem.js` to add efficient reflection toggling
- Updated `MobileLODManager.js` to use property-based LOD transitions
- Added `getTerrainResolutionMultiplier()` method
- Enhanced quality level management logic
- Improved resource cleanup

**Commit Message:** `refactor(lod): eliminate asset recreation in LOD transitions for smoother performance`

**Status:** Complete
