# Water System Implementation

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Create a modular WaterSystem.js inspired by the provided ocean shader example
**Scope:** New file: src/game/systems/WaterSystem.js
**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** Extract water functionality from the example into a modular system that integrates with the game
**Complexity:** 2/3 - Moderate (shader integration and water physics)
**Uncertainty:** 2/3 - Medium (integration with existing systems)
**Unknowns:** 
- How water will interact with other game systems
- Required parameters for initialization
- Texture file locations

**Human Input Needed:** No - implemented based on provided example

## 3. Implementation
```javascript
// Created WaterSystem.js with the following structure:
// - Constructor with config options
// - initialize() method to set up the system
// - loadTextures() to load water normal maps
// - createWater() to generate the water surface
// - createFallbackWater() as a simpler alternative
// - update() method for animation and sun direction
// - Utility methods for water level and underwater detection
```

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made:**
- Created new WaterSystem.js with modular water rendering functionality
- Implemented water surface with customizable parameters
- Added animation and interaction capabilities
- Created fallback implementation if three.js Water module fails to load
- Added methods to test if objects are underwater

**Commit Message:** feat(water): add WaterSystem for ocean surface rendering

**Status:** Complete
