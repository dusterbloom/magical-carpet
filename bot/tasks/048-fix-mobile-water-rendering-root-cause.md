# Task 048: Fix Mobile Water Rendering Root Cause

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Diagnose and fix the root cause of incorrect water color ("brown water") and visual artifacts (flashing) on mobile devices, replacing the current brute-force color override and disabled reflections. Implement scalable water quality settings.

**Scope:** 
- src/game/systems/WaterSystem.js
- src/game/core/Engine.js (renderer settings)

**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:**
1. **Root Cause Analysis**:
   - The issue appears to be a color space/encoding mismatch between desktop and mobile renderers
   - The engine is using THREE.SRGBColorSpace but mobile GPUs may be interpreting colors differently
   - Current fix uses color overrides (0x00aaff/0x00ccff) and disables reflections via zeroMatrix
   
2. **Color Fix Implementation**:
   - Modify the renderer's color space configuration to ensure consistency across platforms
   - Instead of hardcoded colors, implement a proper mobile-compatible color representation
   - Test proper alpha settings for the water material

3. **Scalable Reflection Implementation**:
   - Replace the zeroMatrix approach with a tiered quality system based on device capability
   - Implement dynamic quality levels for reflections:
     - Low: Minimal/no reflections (very small texture size or simpler shader)
     - Medium: Lower resolution reflections with limited features
     - High: Full reflections at appropriate resolution for device

**Complexity:** 2/3 (Involves shader parameters and rendering pipeline)
**Uncertainty:** 1/3 (Root cause is likely color space/encoding mismatch)

**Unknowns:** 
- Specific mobile GPU limitations causing the color shift
- Whether embedded Three.js Water shader can be fully configured for all quality levels

**Human Input Needed:** No

## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Diagnosis
The water color issue is likely caused by:
1. The default water color (0x001e0f) renders differently on mobile GPUs due to color space inconsistencies
2. Three.js Water shader may be using a different internal encoding than expected
3. The outputColorSpace is currently set to THREE.SRGBColorSpace which may need adjustment

### 3.2 Color Fix
1. Update the renderer's color management in Engine.js
2. Use a consistent color format for water that renders correctly on both platforms
3. Implement proper color handling in the Water material

### 3.3 Scalable Reflections
1. Modify WaterSystem.js::createWater to:
   - Replace zeroMatrix with proper reflection matrices based on quality
   - Scale reflection texture size based on quality setting: low(64), medium(256), high(512/1024)
   - Implement conditional shader features based on quality level
2. Update quality switching in the update method to use the new reflection system
3. Ensure performance monitoring still adaptively adjusts quality

### 3.4 Implementation Details
```javascript
// Engine.js changes
// Ensure consistent color space handling
this.renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;
this.renderer.setColorManagement(true);  // Ensure color management is enabled

// WaterSystem.js changes
// Replace hardcoded colors with properly encoded colors
const waterBaseColor = isMobile ? 0x0066aa : 0x001e0f;  // Base color that works on all devices

// Create quality-appropriate reflection matrix instead of zeroMatrix
let reflectionMatrix;
switch(waterQuality) {
  case 'low':
    // Minimal reflection - scale almost to zero but not completely
    reflectionMatrix = new THREE.Matrix4().makeScale(0.1, 0.1, 0.1);
    break;
  case 'medium':
    // Reduced reflection
    reflectionMatrix = new THREE.Matrix4().makeScale(0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
    break;
  case 'high':
    // Full reflection
    reflectionMatrix = new THREE.Matrix4().identity();
    break;
}

// Apply appropriate quality settings instead of zero matrix
water.material.uniforms['textureMatrix'].value = reflectionMatrix;
```
