# Task 068: Fix Skybox Rendering on Mobile Devices

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Fix the skybox rendering issue on mobile devices where the sky turns black when moving forward and shows a black circle when turning back.
**Scope:** Skybox configuration in SkySystem.js, and potentially camera/far plane settings
**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** The issue was caused by a mismatch between skybox size (30000 units), camera far plane (10000 units increased to 25000 for mobile), and terrain view distance. When mobile users move forward, they reach the edge of the skybox relative to the camera's far clipping plane. We need to adjust the skybox size and ensure it follows the camera correctly.
**Complexity:** 2-Moderate
**Uncertainty:** 1-Low

## 3. Implementation
The skybox size was fixed by making the following changes:

1. Removed redundant skybox initialization (there were two initializations in the code)
2. Made skybox radius proportional to camera's far plane (80% of far plane value)
3. Added better mobile-specific settings and segment counts for the geometry
4. Enhanced camera tracking for mobile devices
5. Added rotation correction for mobile to prevent black spots when turning quickly

The key issue was that the skybox needed to be sized in relation to the camera's far plane to prevent the black areas. Instead of using hard-coded values, we now calculate the skybox size as 80% of the camera far plane distance, which ensures compatibility on both mobile and desktop.

The implementation fixes several issues:
- The redundant sky initialization that created two skyboxes
- The inappropriate sizing of the skybox relative to camera far plane
- The "black circle" issue caused by inadequate camera tracking

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made:**
- Fixed redundant skybox initialization
- Made skybox size proportional to camera's far plane (80%)
- Added better mobile-specific handling with appropriate segment counts
- Improved skybox positioning to follow camera closely
- Added rotation correction for mobile devices
- Fixed createFallbackSky and createStandardSky methods

**Commit Message:** Fix skybox rendering on mobile by adjusting size relative to camera far plane

**Status:** Complete
