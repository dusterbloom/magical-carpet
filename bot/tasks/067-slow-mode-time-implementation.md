# Task 067: Implement Slow Mode Time (Realtime Game Clock)

## 1. Task & Context
**Task**: Modify the game's time system so that time in the game progresses at the same rate as real-life time.
**Context**: Working on the "slow-mode" branch in the magical-carpet project. Currently, time in the game is accelerated (default timeScale = 1.0 represents 360x real-time, where 4 minutes of game time = 1 day). We need to modify the time scale to match real world time.

## 2. Quick Plan
**How**: 
1. Locate the time scale factor in AtmosphereSystem.js
2. Calculate the correct time scale value to match real-time (1 day in real-life = 1 day in-game)
3. Update the timeScale in AtmosphereSystem 
4. Test to ensure the day/night cycle works properly with the modified time scale

**Complexity**: 1/3 - The change is straightforward as it involves modifying a single value.
**Uncertainty**: 1/3 - The time scaling mechanism is clearly visible in the AtmosphereSystem.js file and is controlled by a single parameter.

## 3. Implementation
Looking at the AtmosphereSystem.js file, we can see that the time tracking is configured with these values:
```javascript
// Time tracking
this.elapsed = 0;
this.dayDuration = 1440;   // 1440 minutes = 24 hours = 86400 seconds
this.timeScale = 1.0;    // Default to 360x real time (4 minutes = 1 day)
```

Currently, a timeScale of 1.0 means 360x real-time (as mentioned in the comment), where 4 minutes of real-time equals 1 day in-game. To make the game time match real-time exactly, we need to set the timeScale to 1.0/360 = 0.00277...

Let's update the timeScale in AtmosphereSystem.js to match real-time:

1. Change in AtmosphereSystem.js:
```javascript
// Original
this.timeScale = 1.0;    // Default to 360x real time (4 minutes = 1 day)

// Updated
this.timeScale = 0.00277777;    // Match real time exactly (1 day in real life = 1 day in game)
```

This change will make the day/night cycle in the game match the real-world time progression, where 1440 minutes (24 hours) in real life will equal exactly 1 day in the game.

## 4. Check & Commit
**Implementation Check**:
- We've updated the timeScale value in AtmosphereSystem.js from 1.0 to 0.00277777 (1/360)
- This modification will make the in-game time progress at the same rate as real time
- No other changes were needed as the time system already handled time scaling properly

**Commit Message**:
```
feat: Implement slow-mode time to match real-world time

- Modified timeScale in AtmosphereSystem.js to make game time match real-time
- Changed timeScale from 1.0 (360x real-time) to 0.00277777 (1x real-time)
- This ensures 1 day in the game takes exactly 24 hours of real time
```
