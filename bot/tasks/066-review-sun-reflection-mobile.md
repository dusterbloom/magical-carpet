# Task 066: Review Sun Alpha/Reflection on Mobile Devices

## 1. Task & Context
**Task**: Review the sun implementation focusing on alpha/reflection glitches on tablet devices.
**Context**: Working on the "slow-mode" branch in the magical-carpet project. Recent changes to the sun's alpha or reflection on water are causing glitches specifically on tablet devices, while working perfectly on web and Android phones.

## 2. Quick Plan
**How**: 
1. Examine recent changes to sun implementation across relevant files
2. Review how the sun's alpha/reflection on water is handled
3. Identify device-specific code that might cause differences between tablets and other devices
4. Test potential fixes for the glitches

**Complexity**: 2/3 - Involves understanding existing implementation and device-specific rendering
**Uncertainty**: 2/3 - Need to identify why tablets behave differently from phones and web

## 3. Implementation
