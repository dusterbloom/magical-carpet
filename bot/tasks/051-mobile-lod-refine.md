# Task 051: Refine Mobile LOD Management

## 1. Task & Context
**Task**: Improve the MobileLODManager by refining capability detection, smoothing dynamic adjustments, and integrating triangle count into decision logic.

**Scope**: 
- src/game/core/MobileLODManager.js
- Referenced: src/game/core/PerformanceMonitor.js (for triangle count integration)

**Branch**: slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach**:
- Enhance device capability detection with more warning/logging about limitations
- Implement hysteresis for LOD transitions to prevent frequent oscillation
- Incorporate triangle count into decision logic alongside FPS
- Add state tracking variables to manage LOD transitions more smoothly
- Improve logging to provide better visibility into LOD decisions

**Complexity**: 2/3

**Uncertainty**: 1/3 (Available code and metrics are clear, standard techniques like hysteresis can be applied)

**Unknowns**: 
- Optimal threshold values for triangle count (will need to be tuned)
- Effectiveness across diverse mobile devices

## 3. Implementation

### MobileLODManager.js::detectDeviceCapabilities:
- Add logging about detection limitations
- Implement a short initial benchmark on load for baseline FPS
- Refine capability score calculation

### MobileLODManager.js::dynamicallyAdjustLOD:
- Add state variables for quality level and time tracking
- Retrieve and use average triangle count from PerformanceMonitor
- Implement hysteresis with time and performance thresholds
- Create combined FPS and triangle count decision logic
- Add detailed logging for LOD changes

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made**:
- Added hysteresis to prevent rapid quality switches
- Incorporated triangle count into LOD decision logic
- Improved detection logging and initial capability assessment
- Added quality level state tracking for better transitions
- Enhanced logging to explain LOD changes

**Commit Message**: refactor(mobile): Improve MobileLODManager with hysteresis and triangle-based decisions
