# Task 13: Fix Mountain Top Glitches - Completion Report

## Issue Analysis
I identified the cause of the black glitches at the mountain tops as being related to normal calculation issues. At steep mountain slopes and peaks, the automatically calculated normals were causing rendering artifacts that appeared as black areas/glitches.

## Changes Made

1. Created a custom normal calculation method `computeSmoothedNormals()` that:
   - Implements a more robust way to compute face normals
   - Adds special handling for steep slopes and mountain tops, blending with an upward-facing normal
   - Ensures consistent smoothing across the entire terrain

2. Modified the terrain chunk creation process to:
   - Use the custom normal calculation instead of the default `computeVertexNormals()`
   - Apply the smoothed normals both before and after height adjustments
   - Properly ensure all normal vectors are normalized

3. Fixed the rock color calculation for exposed rock on steep slopes:
   - Increased minimum color values to avoid overly dark colors that contributed to the artifacts
   - Applied better color transitions with smoother blending

## Results
The changes fix the black glitches on mountain tops while maintaining the overall visual quality and dramatic appearance of the mountains. The improved normal calculation creates smoother transitions at sharp peaks and steep slopes, eliminating the rendering artifacts while preserving the intended terrain features.

This fix was implemented in a surgical manner, focusing only on the specific issue without affecting other terrain systems or visual elements.
