# Enable LOD for Mobile Devices

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Enable Level of Detail (LOD) for mobile devices to improve performance
**Scope:** Performance monitoring and rendering systems, focusing on WorldSystem, VegetationSystem, and WaterSystem
**Branch:** slow-mode

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** After analyzing the codebase, implement enhanced LOD systems for terrain, vegetation, and water to reduce draw calls and triangle count on mobile devices
**Complexity:** 3-Complex
**Uncertainty:** 1-Low (primary bottlenecks are clear from code review)
**Unknowns:** 
- Exact performance gain from each optimization measure
- How aggressive to make LOD thresholds on various mobile devices

**Human Input Needed:** No - we have enough information to implement effective LOD systems

## 3. Implementation
Based on the code analysis, the main performance bottlenecks are:

1. Terrain geometry complexity - WorldSystem uses a high resolution terrain mesh
2. Vegetation rendering - VegetationSystem already has LOD but can be enhanced for mobile
3. Water reflections - WaterSystem has quality settings but needs distance-based LOD

The implementation will focus on:

- Adding dynamic terrain LOD that reduces mesh resolution based on distance and device capabilities
- Enhancing vegetation system to use more aggressive culling and lower detail on mobile
- Implementing view-distance dependent LOD for water reflections and effects

## 4. Check & Commit
**Status:** In progress - Starting implementation phase
