# Task 062: Centralize Device Capability Detection Logic

## 1. Task & Context
**Task:** Centralize Device Capability Detection Logic
**Scope:** src/game/core/Engine.js, src/game/core/MobileLODManager.js, src/game/core/settings/Settings.js
**Branch:** refactor/centralize-device-detection

## 2. Quick Plan
**Approach:** Create a new DeviceCapabilities utility module that serves as a single source of truth for all device detection, and modify existing systems to use this centralized data.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create a new DeviceCapabilities utility module with comprehensive detection methods
2. Export a singleton instance for use across the game
3. Remove redundant detection from Engine.js
4. Update MobileLODManager to use the centralized data
5. Update Settings.js to use the centralized data

**Complexity:** 2-Moderate
**Uncertainty:** 1-Low

## 3. Implementation
Implementation completed with the following changes:

1. Created a new utility module `src/game/core/utils/DeviceCapabilities.js` that:
   - Provides comprehensive device capability detection
   - Exposes useful helper methods for systems to use
   - Exports a singleton instance for consistency

2. Modified `Engine.js` to:
   - Import the DeviceCapabilities singleton
   - Remove the redundant `_detectDeviceCapabilities()` method
   - Use the centralized device data

3. Updated `MobileLODManager.js` to:
   - Import and use the DeviceCapabilities singleton
   - Simplify its `detectDeviceCapabilities()` method to just use the centralized data
   - Focus on LOD adjustments rather than detection

4. Updated `Settings.js` to:
   - Import and use the DeviceCapabilities singleton
   - Remove redundant mobile detection code
   - Keep stub methods for backward compatibility

## 4. Check & Commit
**Changes Made:**
- Created new `DeviceCapabilities.js` utility module
- Removed redundant detection code from Engine, MobileLODManager and Settings
- Updated all systems to use the centralized device capability data
- Maintained backward compatibility for integrations

**Commit Message:** refactor: Centralize device capability detection logic in a dedicated utility module

**Status:** Completed
