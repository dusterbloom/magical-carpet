  - Replaced beach/shoreline logic with transition slopes
  - Updated mana node placement to not rely on water level
  - Converted water-requiring landmarks to dry land

- `WaterSurface/` directory
  - Emptied relevant files but kept directory structure due to permission issues

- `public/water/` directory

## Validation

- Checked for water references throughout the codebase
- Updated terrain generation to maintain landscape cohesion without water
- Ensured water-dependent gameplay elements like oasis landmarks have land-based alternatives
- Removed all imports and references to the Water-related systems
- Reconfigured mana node placement previously based on water level

## Recommendations

- After testing, we may want to completely remove the `WaterSurface` and `public/water` directories
- Consider updating terrain textures to make former water areas more visually appealing
