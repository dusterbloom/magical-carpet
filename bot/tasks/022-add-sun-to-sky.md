# Task 022: Add Sun to Sky

## Task & Context
Add a sun to the sky using ThreeJS Sky from the example code provided.

**Files modified:**
- src/game/systems/AtmosphereSystem.js

## Quick Plan
1. Import the Sky class from Three.js addons
2. Implement a sky with sun in the AtmosphereSystem class
3. Configure the sky and sun parameters
4. Update the sky and sun position based on time of day
5. Add a visible sun sphere for better visual clarity

**Complexity**: 2/3
**Uncertainty**: 2/3 (Needed to verify that imported Sky class works correctly in our setup)

## Implementation
1. Added the Sky import from three/examples/jsm/objects/Sky.js
2. Created a new method `createSkyWithSun()` to replace the previous `createSky()` method
3. Connected the sky and sun to the time of day cycle
4. Made sure the sky follows the camera position
5. Removed conflicting sky implementations
6. Added a visible sun sphere with glow effect for better visibility
7. Modified sun position calculation to keep it more visible in the sky

### Key changes:
- Replaced the custom sky shader with ThreeJS Sky implementation
- Adjusted atmospheric scattering parameters to make the sun more prominent
- Created a visible sun sphere with a glow effect
- Positioned the sun sphere to match the calculated sun position
- Modified elevation calculation to keep the sun more visible (30-90 degrees range)
- Updated the sunlight position to match the sun position

## Check & Commit
- The sun now appears clearly in the sky as a bright sphere with glow
- The sun moves correctly across the sky based on time of day
- Lighting changes appropriately with sun position
- Performance is not significantly impacted by the changes
- Visual quality is improved with more realistic atmospheric scattering effects

## Future Improvements
- Adjust sun color and intensity based on time of day
- Add lens flare effect when looking at the sun
- Implement more advanced cloud interactions with sunlight
- Improve water reflections to show sun reflections
