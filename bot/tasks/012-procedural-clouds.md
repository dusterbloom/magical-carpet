# Task 12: Implement Procedural Clouds Using Three.js Sprites

## Task & Context
The current cloud system in AtmosphereSystem.js uses basic sprites for clouds. We need to replace it with a more realistic procedural cloud system based on the technique described in the PDF article. This will involve using a custom shader material that extends Three.js SpriteMaterial.

The new clouds should:
1. Use a procedural approach with noise textures
2. Have realistic volumetric appearance
3. Animate smoothly
4. Perform well in our game environment

Files to modify:
- src/game/systems/AtmosphereSystem.js

## Quick Plan
1. Create a new CloudSpriteMaterial class that extends Three.js ShaderMaterial
2. Implement the fragment and vertex shaders from the article
3. Replace the current cloud creation method with the new approach
4. Ensure the clouds follow the player and integrate with day/night cycle

Complexity: 3/3 (involves complex shader programming)
Uncertainty: 2/3 (implementing 3D techniques from a PDF tutorial may require adaptation)

## Implementation
1. Add a new CloudMaterial class to AtmosphereSystem.js
2. Implement the fragment and vertex shaders from the article
3. Replace createClouds and updateClouds methods
4. Remove the createVolumetricClouds method (will be merged into the new implementation)
5. Ensure textures are properly loaded and managed

## Check & Commit
- Verify the new clouds look similar to those in the article
- Check performance with multiple clouds in the scene
- Ensure clouds animate properly and look good in different lighting conditions
- Confirm compatibility with the existing atmosphere system
