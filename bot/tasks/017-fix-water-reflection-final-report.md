# Task 017: Fix Water Reflection Flickering - Final Implementation

## Changes Made
I've successfully implemented the solution to fix the water reflection flickering:

1. **Removed Position Rounding**
   ```diff
   -this.water.position.x = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.x);
   -this.water.position.z = Math.round(this.engine.camera.position.z);
   +this.water.position.x = this.engine.camera.position.x;
   +this.water.position.z = this.engine.camera.position.z;
   ```
   This eliminates the "jumping" effect that was causing the most noticeable flickering.

2. **Adjusted Distortion Scale**
   ```diff
   -distortionScale: 1.7,
   +distortionScale: 1.5,
   ```
   Reduced the distortion scale to create more subtle, realistic water ripples.

3. **Added Clip Bias**
   ```diff
   +clipBias: 0.00001,
   ```
   Added clip bias to prevent self-reflection artifacts that could contribute to flickering.

## Note
The texture resolution was already at 2048x2048, which is excellent quality for the water surface size. This higher resolution (compared to the initially anticipated 512x512) helps ensure detailed reflections.

## Expected Results
These changes should completely eliminate the reflection flickering by:
1. Ensuring smooth water movement with the camera
2. Creating more subtle distortion effects
3. Preventing rendering artifacts through proper clip bias

The water reflections should now appear smooth and natural at all altitudes, with the most noticeable improvement when flying at lower altitudes.
