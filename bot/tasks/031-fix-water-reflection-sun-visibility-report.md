# Fix Water Reflection Sun Visibility - Implementation Report

## Problem
The water reflection was showing the sun even when the sun was below the horizon or should be hidden, creating an unrealistic visual effect.

## Analysis
After investigating the issue, I identified these key findings:

1. The Three.js Water object uses a separate camera (reflectionCamera) to render scene reflections
2. This reflection camera doesn't automatically respect the visibility settings of objects
3. Direct manipulation of sun visibility properties wasn't reliable, as shown in initial testing
4. The Three.js layers system provides a more reliable way to control what the reflection camera can see

## Solution
I implemented a comprehensive solution using Three.js rendering layers:

1. **Placed the sun on a dedicated layer:**
   - Modified SunSystem.js to place the sun on rendering layer 10
   - This allows selective rendering of the sun in reflections

2. **Controlled reflection camera layers:**
   - Added logic to WaterSystem.js to initialize the reflection camera's layers
   - Created logic to enable/disable the sun layer in the reflection camera based on the sun's position
   - Used the horizon check (sunPos.y > HORIZON_LEVEL) to determine if the sun should be visible

3. **Ensured proper cleanup:**
   - Maintained reference to the original onBeforeRender method
   - Restored it in the dispose method to prevent memory leaks

## Implementation Details
The key insight was using Three.js layers rather than manipulating visibility properties directly. Layers provide a way to control which objects are rendered by specific cameras without affecting their visibility in the main scene.

This approach is more reliable because:
- It works at the rendering level rather than the object level
- It's immune to timing issues or state conflicts
- It properly integrates with Three.js's rendering pipeline

## Testing
The implementation should now correctly hide the sun in water reflections when the sun is below the horizon, while still showing the sun's reflection when it's visible in the sky.

## Commit
The changes were committed with message: `fix(water): prevent sun reflection when sun is below horizon`
