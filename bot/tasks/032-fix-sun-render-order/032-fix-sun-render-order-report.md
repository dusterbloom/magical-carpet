# Task 032 Completion Report: Fix Sun Render Order

## Changes Implemented
I've modified the sun rendering properties to ensure it's always rendered as the furthest background element in the scene, making sunrise and sunset effects more plausible.

### Technical Details:
1. **Disabled Depth Testing/Writing**: 
   - Changed `depthWrite: true` to `depthWrite: false`
   - Changed `depthTest: true` to `depthTest: false`
   - This ensures the sun isn't occluded by any other 3D elements in the scene

2. **Changed Render Order**:
   - Changed from `renderOrder: 10000` to `renderOrder: -1`
   - In Three.js, objects with lower renderOrder values are rendered first
   - Setting it to -1 ensures the sun is drawn before other scene elements

3. **Applied to Both Sun and Glow**:
   - Changes were made to both the main sun material and the glow effect material

## Expected Results
- The sun will now always appear as the furthest background element
- It will never be occluded by mountains, terrain, or other elements
- This will create more realistic sunrise/sunset effects where the sun appears to gradually rise from or descend into the horizon

## Testing Notes
The changes should be visually apparent when playing the game:
- The sun should always be visible on the horizon when it's supposed to be
- During sunrise/sunset, the sun should appear to gradually emerge from or sink below the horizon
- The sun should never be "cut off" unnaturally by terrain elements

## Future Considerations
- If further refinements are needed for the sun's appearance, we could consider implementing a customized shader for the sun
- For more advanced effects, we might want to implement atmospheric scattering for even more realistic sunrise/sunset colors
